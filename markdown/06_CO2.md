GENERAL INFORMATION
Equation format: "typical useful energy demand equation"
The main explanatory variables (drivers) are activity indicators (economic activity) and corresponding energy costs.
The type of "demand" is computed based on its past value, the ratio of the current and past activity indicators (with the corresponding elasticity), 
and the ratio of lagged energy costs (with the corresponding elasticities). This type of equation captures both short term and long term reactions to energy costs. 
* CO2 SEQUESTRATION COST CURVES
The equation calculates the CO2 captured by electricity and hydrogen production plants
in million tons of CO2 for a specific scenario and year. The CO2 capture is determined by summing 
the product of electricity production from plants with carbon capture and storage, the conversion
factor from terawatt-hours to million tons of oil equivalent (smTWhToMtoe), the plant efficiency,
the CO2 emission factor, and the plant CO2 capture rate.

The equation calculates the cumulative CO2 captured in million tons of CO2 for a given scenario and year.

The equation calculates the cost curve for CO2 sequestration costs in Euro per ton of CO2 sequestered
for a specific scenario and year. The cost curve is determined based on cumulative CO2 captured and
elasticities for the CO2 sequestration cost curve.The equation is formulated to represent a flexible cost curve that
can transition from linear to exponential. The transition is controlled by the weight for the transition from linear to exponential
The cost curve is expressed as a combination of linear and exponential functions, allowing for a realistic.
representation of the relationship between cumulative CO2 captured and sequestration costs. This equation provides a dynamic and
realistic approach to modeling CO2 sequestration costs, considering the cumulative CO2 captured and the associated elasticities
for the cost curve. The result represents the cost of sequestering one ton of CO2 in the specified scenario and year.
