# How to Load Data Files with mrprom
In this tutorial, you will find a brief guide about loading input data files to the OPEN-PROM model. This is accomplished by utilizing the complementary [`mrprom`](https://github.com/e3modelling/mrprom) R package, that is also developed by E3-Modelling.

## Installing Necessary Software and Libraries
Before using the `mrprom` package, you'll need to install a recent version of the R language, available for [download here](https://www.r-project.org/). Furthermore, R should be added to the PATH variable of your OS, so check the instructions for [Windows](https://www.bbminfo.com/r/r-programming-environment-setup.php) and [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-view-and-update-the-linux-path-environment-variable), respectively. After making sure that R is correctly set up on your system, launch the R console and execute the following commands:

```
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
devtools::install_github("GAMS-dev/gdxrrw/gdxrrw")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/e3modelling/mrprom")
```

Those commands will install the `mrprom` package, as well as additional dependencies that are necessary for its functionality. Please note, that you may be prompted to install the RTools utility, so proceed in doing that too.

## Executing the OPEN-PROM Model 
As mentioned in the VS Code Task Runner Tutorial (01), the OPEN-PROM model can be executed by clicking **Task Runner > OPEN-PROM DEV** on the Visual Studio Code menu. This will invoke the `LoadMadratData.R` script that utilizes the `mrprom` package, and processes all datasets that are necessary to successfuly run the model. If everything goes well, a number of CSV files will be stored in the root directory of OPEN-PROM, along with some additional configuration and diagnostics files that are generated by `mrprom`. The entire process output will be available on the Visual Studio Code terminal, so you can catch any errors, or simply monitor the R and GAMS code execution!
