# How to Load Data Files with mrprom
In this tutorial, you will find a brief guide about loading input data files to the OPEN-PROM model. This is accomplished by utilizing the complementary [`mrprom`](https://github.com/e3modelling/mrprom) R package, that is also developed by E3-Modelling.

## Installing Necessary Software and Libraries
Before using the `mrprom` package, you'll need to install a recent version of the R language, available for [download here](https://www.r-project.org/), as well as Rtools (software that allows compilation of R packages from source code), available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Make sure to install both in folders that do not require admin priviledges! Furthermore, R and Rtools should be added to the PATH variable of your OS, so check the instructions for [Windows](https://www.bbminfo.com/r/r-programming-environment-setup.php) and [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-view-and-update-the-linux-path-environment-variable), respectively. After making sure that R is correctly set up on your system, launch the R console and execute the following commands:

```
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("GAMS-dev/gdxrrw/gdxrrw")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/e3modelling/mrprom")
```

Those commands will install the `mrprom` package, as well as additional dependencies that are necessary for its functionality. Please note, that you may be prompted to install the RTools utility, so proceed in doing that too.

## Adding the Data Sources
Apart from installing the software, you also need to include the necessary data sources to the associated local directory of `madrat`, with instructions being available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/madrat/vignettes/madrat.html). Due to the proprietary nature of those datasets, we can't share them publicly, so you'll have to acquire them yourself, or contact us for further guidance. Furthermore, if you are interested in testing the model with dummy datasets that are openly provided by E3-Modelling, please refer to Tutorial 03 for instructions.

## Input Data Overview
The `mrprom` package calc functions generate a multitude of datasets, originating from various reputable sources. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we have created a spreadsheet about all the datasets utilized by the OPEN-PROM model, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3F7FAqbyMsiCaNLlSvSZY_ZO_WNZG6_44NLjHFZcx8/edit?usp=sharing). In this spreadsheet, you can find information about every dataset generated by `mrprom`, along with the original source, as well as a brief description of the resulting OPEN-PROM input parameter.

## Executing the OPEN-PROM Model 
As mentioned in the VS Code Task Runner Tutorial (01), the OPEN-PROM model can be executed by clicking **Task Runner > OPEN-PROM DEV** on the Visual Studio Code menu. This will invoke the `LoadMadratData.R` script that utilizes the `mrprom` package, and processes all datasets that are necessary to successfuly run the model. If everything goes well, a number of CSV files will be stored in the root directory of OPEN-PROM, along with some additional configuration and diagnostics files that are generated by `mrprom`. The entire process output will be available on the Visual Studio Code terminal, so you can catch any errors, or simply monitor the R and GAMS code execution!
