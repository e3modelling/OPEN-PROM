OPEN-PROM starts with the main file of the model, called `main.gms`. This file contains some GAMS internal settings, the basic model and scenario settings, as well as lists the files that GAMS will have to read and execute after `main.gms`. By typing `gams main.gms` in the console, or using the `OPEN-PROM DEV` task runner button in VScode (see Tutorial 00) the model will start. If input data loading is activated, an R script will run before OPEN-PROM actually starts (more in Turorial 02). The function of this R script is to perform the input data calculations, using the R package [`mrprom`](https://github.com/e3modelling/mrprom).
