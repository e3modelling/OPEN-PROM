# Task Runner Tutorial

This tutorial is a step by step guide to installing the task runner extension as well as utilizing a custom button, whose function is to run the GAMS code exactly like the Run (F9) button in *GAMS studio*.

*Warning:*
It is recommended that you follow this tutorial after you have successfully completed the [how-to-install-vscode-and-git-tutorial](https://github.com/e3modelling/OPEN-PROM/Tutorials/Git-and-VS-Code) and have cloned the repository and added all the necessary extensions.

## Step by step guide

- Search for the `Task Runner` extension by _Sana Ajani_ and install it.

- Restart VScode, open the cloned repository folder and click on the explorer tab, in the left hand sidebar. On the bottom of the opened tab you should see the Task Runner drop down list. Click on it and the GAMS button should be visible.

**You are all set up!!!**
