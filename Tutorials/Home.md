Welcome to the OPEN-PROM wiki!

The contents of the wiki are listed on the right (under "Pages").

OPEN-PROM ("open PROMETHEUS") is an energy-economy model currently under development; the present version is based on MENA-EDS ENERGY MODEL v4.0 (c) E3Modelling 2020.

Extensive documentation of the PROMETHEUS model (on which both MENA-EDS and OPEN-PROM are based) can be found here: https://e3modelling.com/modelling-tools/prometheus/

OPEN-PROM is written in GAMS (*G*eneral *A*lgebraic *M*odelling *S*ystem https://gams.com/) and its main file is `main.gms`.

Model developers: To have the necessary software (GAMS, Git, VScode), install GAMS (if you haven't done so already), add GAMS to your PATH variable, and then proceed to this Wiki page:  [Task Runner Tutorial](https://github.com/e3modelling/OPEN-PROM/wiki/VS-code-Task-Runner-Tutorial)
