# Task Runner Tutorial

This tutorial is a step by step guide to installing the task runner extension as well as utilizing a custom button, whose function is to run the GAMS code exactly like the Run (F9) button in *GAMS studio*.

*Warning:*
(It is recommended that you follow this tutorial after you have successfully completed the Tutorial 00) and have cloned the repository and added all the necessary extensions.

## Step by step guide

- Search for the `Task Runner` extension by _Sana Ajani_ and install it.

- Restart VScode, open the cloned repository folder and click on the explorer tab, in the left hand sidebar. On the bottom of the opened tab you should see the Task Runner drop down list. Click on it and the OPEN-PROM tasks should be visible.

## Development and Research Modes
The aforementioned tasks are comprised of two modes for the OPEN-PROM model, i.e. development and research. As the names suggest, development mode should be used when adding new features and modifying the model code, whereas research mode is preferable when studying various policy scenarios. It should be noted that the research mode requires more computational resources, and takes longer to complete executing, whereas the development mode is less demanding. In case you want to study the command line flags of each mode, you can check the `.vscode/tasks.json` file.

**You are all set up!!!**
