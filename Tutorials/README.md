Welcome to the OPEN-PROM tutorial!

The contents of the tutorial are listed on the left (in "Tutorials" folder).

Necessary software: GAMS (required); R, Git, GAMS Studio/VS Code (optional)

Model users: Install GAMS (if you haven't done so already), add GAMS (and R) to your PATH variable, and then proceed with Tutorial 03. Note that to run the model you need input data, which are not distributed with the model code. If you don't have the data please get in touch with us: giannousakis@e3modelling.com

Model developers: Install GAMS (if you haven't done so already), add GAMS (and R) to your PATH variable, and then proceed with Tutorial 00

OPEN-PROM ("open PROMETHEUS") is an energy-economy model currently under development; the present version is based on MENA-EDS ENERGY MODEL v4.0 (c) E3Modelling 2020.

Extensive documentation of the PROMETHEUS model (on which both MENA-EDS and OPEN-PROM are based) can be found here: https://e3modelling.com/modelling-tools/prometheus/

OPEN-PROM is written in GAMS (*G*eneral *A*lgebraic *M*odelling *S*ystem https://gams.com/) and its main file is `main.gms`.
