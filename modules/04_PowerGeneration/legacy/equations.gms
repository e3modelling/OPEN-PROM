*' GENERAL INFORMATION

*' Equation format: "typical useful energy demand equation"
*' The main explanatory variables (drivers) are activity indicators (economic activity) and corresponding energy costs.
*' The type of "demand" is computed based on its past value, the ratio of the current and past activity indicators (with the corresponding elasticity), 
*' and the ratio of lagged energy costs (with the corresponding elasticities). This type of equation captures both short term and long term reactions to energy costs. 

*' Power Generation

*' This equation computes the current renewable potential, which is the average of the maximum allowed renewable potential and the minimum renewable potential
*' for a given power generation sector and energy form in a specific time period. The result is the current renewable potential in gigawatts (GW).
