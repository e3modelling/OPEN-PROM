is based on MENA-EDS ENERGY MODEL v4.0 (c) E3Modelling 2020

Some preliminary documentation of OPEN-PROM can be found in the Tutorials folder, extensive documentation of the PROMETHEUS model (on which both MENA-EDS and OPEN-PROM are based) can be found here: https://e3modelling.com/modelling-tools/prometheus/

OPEN-PROM is written in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System) and its main file is `main.gms`.
