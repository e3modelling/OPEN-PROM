*' * Coding Etiquette:
*' * Below, you'll find the coding etiquette, a collection of conventions designed to streamline the development process and enhance code readability.
*' * Please uphold these standards as you code! The naming convention for objects in the code is established as follows:
*' * [ prefix ][ object type (e.g. Capacity, Cost, Share, etc.) ][ more specific information, if needed ][ object scope, e.g. Transport, Electricity, etc. ][ more specific information, if needed ]
*' * Example:
*' * [ Q/V/i ][ Cost/Cap/Dem/Cons/Price/etc. ][ Total ][ Elec/Tr/Ind/Dom ][ etc. ]
*' * Q: Equation
*' * q: Equation whose main computed variable does not participate in more than one equation, thus has decreased impact on the model
*' * V: Variable, main variable computed by each equation
*' * v: Variable that does not participate in more than one equation, thus has decreased impact on the model
*' * i: Input, Inputs are datasets or constants that are exogenous to the model
*' * Cost: Cost
*' * Cap: Capacity
*' * Dem: Demand
*' * Pow: Power
*' * Prod: Production
*' * Cons: Consumption
*' * Gen: Generation
*' * Req: Required
*' * Price: Pri
*' * Fin: Final
*' * Ene: Energy
*' * Elec: Electricity
*' * Ren: Renwable
*' * Sec: Sector
*' * Contr: Contribution
*' * Curr: Current
*' * Pot: Potential
*' * Tr: Transport
*' * Ind: Industry
*' * Inv: Investment
*' * Dom: Domestic
*' * Dec: Decision
*' * Mat: Maturity
*' * Fac: Factor
*' * Mult: Multiplier
*' * Endog: Endogenous
*' * Exog: Exogenous
*' * Allow: Allowed
*' * Maxm: Maximum
*' * Mnm: Minimum
*' * Pc: Passenger Cars
*' * Cum: Cummulative
*' * Imp: Imports
*' * Exp: Exports
*' * Bsl: Base Load
*' * Tot: Total
*' * Tech: Technology
*' * Var: Variable
*' * Pol: Policy
*' * Chp: Combined Heat and Power plants
*' * Ccs: Carbon capture and storage
*' * Clim: Climate
*' * Est: Estimated
*' * Transf: Transformation
*' * Capt: Captured
*' * Seq: Sequestration
*' * NAP: National Allocation Plan
*' * Carb: Carbon
*' * Val: Value
*' * Sub: Subsector
*' * Avg: Average
*' * Consu: Consumers
*' @stop The following code will be ignored by goxygen until the next identifier.
*' *** Generating an execution profile
option profile = 0;
*' *** Number of columns that are listed for each variable in the column listing
option limcol = 0;
*' *** Number of rows that are listed for each equation in the equation listing
option limrow = 0;
*' *** Save a GDX file after each solve, containing all computed variables (0 off, 1 on)
option savepoint = 0;
*' *** Print solution in .lst file (on/off)
option solprint = off;

*' *** "dollar" ($) commands section: define GAMS flags & code control & compilation-time options
*  *** onDollar activates printing of the $commands to .lst file
$onDollar
*' *** onEolCom: turn on end-of-line comments (starting with !!, i.e. the GAMS default)
$onEolCom
*' *** onEnd: turn on alternative flow control syntax (more readable loop, for, if etc.)
$onEnd
*' *** onEmpty allows declarations of empty parameters
$onEmpty
*' *** offOrder allows ord operator on dynamic sets
$offOrder

*' *** GAMS "flags" definitions
*' 
*' *** Maximum number of solver attempts
$evalGlobal SolverTryMax 4
*' *** Setting research mode (0) or development mode (1) to modify settings and parameters accordingly
$setGlobal DevMode 0 !! can be overwritten if VS Code Tasks are used
*' *** Write a GDX file with all data at the end of the run
$setGlobal WriteGDX on
*' *** Generate input data?
$setGlobal GenerateInput on !! can be overwritten if VS Code Tasks are used

$setGlobal fCountries 'MAR,IND,USA,EGY,RWO' !! can be overwritten if VS Code Tasks are used

$setGlobal fCountryList %countries%
